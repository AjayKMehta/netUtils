\title{Homophilic random graph using BA preferential attachment model}
\usage{
sample_pa_homophilic(n, m, minority_fraction, h_ab, h_ba = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of nodes}

\item{m}{number of edges a new node is connected to}

\item{minority_fraction}{fraction of nodes that belong to the minority group}

\item{h_ab}{probability to connect a node from group a with groub b}

\item{h_ba}{probability to connect a node from group b with groub a. If NULL, h_ab is used.}
}
\value{
igraph object
}
\description{
A graph of n nodes is grown by attaching new nodes each with m
edges that are preferentially attached to existing nodes with high
degree, depending on the homophily parameters.
